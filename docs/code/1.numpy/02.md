## Introduction

**NumPy** (short for **Numerical Python**) is one of the most fundamental libraries in the Python data science ecosystem.
It provides **powerful tools for numerical computation**, especially when working with **arrays, matrices, and linear algebra operations**.

Almost every other data-related Python library â€” such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Scikit-Learn**, and **TensorFlow** â€” internally depends on NumPy for its numerical operations and data structures.

> Think of NumPy as the mathematical engine that powers Pythonâ€™s data and scientific computing capabilities.

## Why NumPy?

In standard Python, working with lists for numerical computation can be **slow
and inefficient** because:

- Python lists are **heterogeneous** (they can hold mixed data types like int,
  str, float, etc.).
- Each list element is stored as a separate Python object, leading to **high
  memory overhead**.
- Numerical operations (like sum or multiplication) must be done with explicit
  loops.

NumPy solves these issues by:

- Using **homogeneous, fixed-type arrays** for faster computation.
- Storing data in **contiguous memory blocks**, allowing efficient vectorized
  operations.
- Leveraging **optimized C and Fortran libraries** under the hood for
  performance.

## Installing NumPy

You can install NumPy using either **Conda** (recommended if using Anaconda) or
**pip**.

### Using Anaconda (Recommended)

```bash
conda install numpy
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install numpy
```

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Always install NumPy in your terminal or command prompt â€” **not**
> inside the Python interpreter.

---

## Verifying Installation

Once installed, open a Python shell or Jupyter notebook and verify:

```python
import numpy as np
print(np.__version__)
```

If no errors appear and a version number is printed (like `2.1.0`), NumPy is
successfully installed.

## What Makes NumPy So Powerful?

### 1. **ndarray (N-Dimensional Array)**

The core of NumPy is the **`ndarray`** object â€” a fast, memory-efficient
**multi-dimensional array**.

- 1D arrays are called **vectors**.
- 2D arrays are called **matrices**.
- 3D or higher-dimensional arrays are used in advanced data science and deep
  learning (e.g., images, tensors).

Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# 1D Vector
vector = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# 2D Matrix
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

print("Vector:\n", vector)
print("Matrix:\n", matrix)
```

**Output:**

```
Vector:
 [1 2 3]
Matrix:
 [[1 2 3]
  [4 5 6]]
```

---

### 2. **Vectors vs. Matrices**

| Type       | Dimensions | Example                    | Description                      |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Vector** | 1D         | `[1, 2, 3]`                | Single row or column of data     |
| **Matrix** | 2D         | `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`   | Rows Ã— Columns table             |
| **Tensor** | 3D+        | `[[[1], [2]], [[3], [4]]]` | Used for images, neural networks |

> Even though matrices are 2D, they can still have just one row or one column
> (e.g., shape `(1, 3)` or `(3, 1)`).

---

### 3. **Key Features of NumPy**

- **Vectorization:** Perform operations on entire arrays without loops.

  ```python
  arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
  print(arr * 10)  # [10, 20, 30]
  ```

- **Broadcasting:** Automatically expands dimensions for element-wise
  operations.

  ```python
  arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
  arr2 = np.array([[1], [2], [3]])
  print(arr + arr2)
  # Adds each element of arr to each row of arr2
  ```

- **Memory Efficiency:** NumPy arrays consume less memory compared to lists.

- **Interoperability:** Easily integrates with C, C++, Fortran, and GPU-based
  frameworks.

---

## Internal Architecture of NumPy

NumPy arrays are **thin wrappers around C arrays** with:

1. **Data buffer** (raw binary data)
2. **Metadata** (shape, dtype, strides)
3. **Vectorized APIs** (for computation)

This makes NumPy operations **~50â€“100Ã— faster** than native Python loops.

Example comparison:

```python
import numpy as np
import time

# Python list
L = list(range(1_000_000))
start = time.time()
sum_L = [x * 2 for x in L]
print("Python list time:", time.time() - start)

# NumPy array
A = np.arange(1_000_000)
start = time.time()
sum_A = A * 2
print("NumPy array time:", time.time() - start)
```

## Commonly Used NumPy Methods (Preview)

| Method                          | Description                        |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `np.array()`                    | Create an array                    |
| `np.arange(start, stop, step)`  | Create evenly spaced values        |
| `np.zeros(shape)`               | Create an array of zeros           |
| `np.ones(shape)`                | Create an array of ones            |
| `np.eye(n)`                     | Identity matrix                    |
| `np.linspace(start, stop, num)` | Evenly spaced numbers over a range |
| `np.random.rand()`              | Random numbers between 0 and 1     |
| `np.mean(), np.sum(), np.std()` | Statistical operations             |

These will be explored in depth in upcoming sections.

## Example: Creating Vectors and Matrices

```python
import numpy as np

# Vector
v = np.array([10, 20, 30])
print("Vector:\n", v)

# Matrix
m = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print("Matrix:\n", m)

# Vector addition
print("v + 10 =", v + 10)

# Matrix transposition
print("Transpose of m:\n", m.T)
```

**Output:**

```
Vector:
 [10 20 30]
Matrix:
 [[1 2 3]
  [4 5 6]]
v + 10 = [20 30 40]
Transpose of m:
 [[1 4]
  [2 5]
  [3 6]]
```
