# Introduction to NumPy

## What is NumPy?

NumPy (short for **Numerical Python**) is one of the most important Python
libraries for numerical computing. It is widely used in:

- Data Science
- Machine Learning & AI
- Engineering simulations
- Mathematical modeling
- Scientific research

Python itself is easy to use but can be **slow** when dealing with large
datasets. That’s where **NumPy** helps — it is written in **C (fast)** under the
hood and provides **NumPy arrays**, which are:

- **Much faster** than Python lists
- Allow **vectorized operations** (apply operations to the whole array at once,
  without loops)
- Provide advanced tools for **linear algebra, statistics, random number
  generation, filtering, etc.**

## Installing NumPy

Open your **terminal** or IDE terminal (like PyCharm, VSCode, or Anaconda
Prompt) and type:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

---

## Importing NumPy

By convention, we import NumPy as `np`:

```python
import numpy as np
```

To check the installed version:

```python
print(np.__version__)
```

---

## Python Lists vs NumPy Arrays

### Example with Python list

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_list * 2)   # Duplicates the list -> [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]
```

### Example with NumPy array

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(arr * 2)   # Multiplies each element -> [2,4,6,8]
```

✅ NumPy arrays allow **element-wise mathematical operations**, unlike Python
lists.

# Working with NumPy

## 1. Creating Arrays

```python
# 1D array
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])

# 2D array (Matrix)
arr2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Zero array
zeros = np.zeros((3,3))  # 3x3 matrix of zeros

# Ones array
ones = np.ones((2,2))    # 2x2 matrix of ones

# Range of numbers
r = np.arange(0, 10, 2)  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

# Evenly spaced numbers
lin = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)  # [0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1]
```

---

## 2. Dimensions in Arrays

```python
arr0 = np.array(5)  # 0D
arr1 = np.array([1,2,3])  # 1D
arr2 = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])  # 2D
arr3 = np.array([[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], [[7,8,9],[10,11,12]]])  # 3D

print(arr3.ndim)   # Number of dimensions -> 3
print(arr3.shape)  # Shape (layers, rows, cols)
```

---

## 3. Indexing and Slicing

```python
arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4],
                [5,6,7,8],
                [9,10,11,12],
                [13,14,15,16]])

# Row selection
print(arr[0])   # First row -> [1,2,3,4]

# Column selection
print(arr[:,1]) # Second column -> [2,6,10,14]

# Slice rows and columns
print(arr[0:2, 0:2])  # Top-left 2x2 -> [[1,2],[5,6]]

# Negative indexing
print(arr[-1])   # Last row -> [13,14,15,16]
```

---

## 4. Arithmetic with Arrays

```python
arr = np.array([1,2,3])

# Scalar operations
print(arr + 2)   # [3,4,5]
print(arr * 3)   # [3,6,9]

# Vectorized functions
print(np.sqrt(arr))  # Square roots
print(np.round([1.5, 2.3, 3.9]))  # [2,2,4]

# Elementwise operations
a = np.array([1,2,3])
b = np.array([4,5,6])
print(a + b)   # [5,7,9]
print(a * b)   # [4,10,18]

# Comparisons
scores = np.array([91,55,100,73,82,64])
print(scores >= 60)  # Boolean array -> [True False True True True True]
```

---

## 5. Broadcasting

Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on **different-shaped arrays**.

```python
a = np.array([[1,2,3,4]])     # Shape (1,4)
b = np.array([[1],[2],[3],[4]]) # Shape (4,1)

print(a * b)
# Expands to 4x4 multiplication table
```

---

## 6. Aggregate Functions

```python
arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5],
                [6,7,8,9,10]])

print(np.sum(arr))     # 55
print(np.mean(arr))    # 5.5
print(np.std(arr))     # Standard deviation
print(np.var(arr))     # Variance
print(np.min(arr))     # Minimum
print(np.max(arr))     # Maximum
print(np.argmin(arr))  # Index of min
print(np.argmax(arr))  # Index of max

# Column-wise sum
print(np.sum(arr, axis=0))  # [7,9,11,13,15]

# Row-wise sum
print(np.sum(arr, axis=1))  # [15,40]
```

---

## 7. Filtering

```python
ages = np.array([21,17,19,20,16,30,18,65,39,22,15,99])

# Teenagers (<18)
print(ages[ages < 18])   # [17,16,15]

# Adults (18–64)
print(ages[(ages >= 18) & (ages < 65)])

# Seniors (65+)
print(ages[ages >= 65])  # [65,99]

# Even numbers
print(ages[ages % 2 == 0])
```

---

## 8. Random Numbers

```python
rng = np.random.default_rng()

# Random integers
print(rng.integers(low=1, high=7))       # Simulate dice (1-6)
print(rng.integers(1, 101, size=5))      # 5 random numbers between 1–100

# Random floats
print(rng.uniform(-1, 1, size=(3,2)))    # 3x2 matrix of floats

# Shuffle array
arr = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
rng.shuffle(arr)
print(arr)

# Random choice
fruits = np.array(["apple","orange","banana","coconut","pineapple"])
print(rng.choice(fruits, size=(3,3)))
```

---
