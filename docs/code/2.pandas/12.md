# SF Salaries Exercise - Solutions

Welcome to a quick exercise for you to practice your pandas skills! We will be
using the [SF Salaries Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/sf-salaries) from
Kaggle! Just follow along and complete the tasks outlined in bold below. The
tasks will get harder and harder as you go along.

**Import pandas as pd.**

```python
import pandas as pd
```

**Read Salaries.csv as a dataframe called sal.**

```python
sal = pd.read_csv('Salaries.csv')
```

**Check the head of the DataFrame.**

```python
sal.head()
```

**Use the .info() method to find out how many entries there are.**

```python
sal.info() # 148654 Entries
```

**What is the average BasePay ?**

```python
sal['BasePay'].mean()
```

**What is the highest amount of OvertimePay in the dataset ?**

```python
sal['OvertimePay'].max()
```

**What is the job title of JOSEPH DRISCOLL ? Note: Use all caps, otherwise you
may get an answer that doesn't match up (there is also a lowercase Joseph
Driscoll).**

```python
sal[sal['EmployeeName']=='JOSEPH DRISCOLL']['JobTitle']
```

**How much does JOSEPH DRISCOLL make (including benefits)?**

```python
sal[sal['EmployeeName']=='JOSEPH DRISCOLL']['TotalPayBenefits']
```

**What is the name of highest paid person (including benefits)?**

```python
sal[sal['TotalPayBenefits']== sal['TotalPayBenefits'].max()] #['EmployeeName']
# or
# sal.loc[sal['TotalPayBenefits'].idxmax()]
```

**What is the name of lowest paid person (including benefits)? Do you notice
something strange about how much he or she is paid?**

```python
sal[sal['TotalPayBenefits']== sal['TotalPayBenefits'].min()] #['EmployeeName']
# or
# sal.loc[sal['TotalPayBenefits'].idxmax()]['EmployeeName']

## ITS NEGATIVE!! VERY STRANGE
```

**What was the average (mean) BasePay of all employees per year? (2011-2014) ?
**

```python
sal.groupby('Year').mean()['BasePay']
```

**How many unique job titles are there?**

```python
sal['JobTitle'].nunique()
```

**What are the top 5 most common jobs?**

```python
sal['JobTitle'].value_counts().head(5)
```

**How many Job Titles were represented by only one person in 2013? (e.g. Job
Titles with only one occurence in 2013?)**

```python
sum(sal[sal['Year']==2013]['JobTitle'].value_counts() == 1) # pretty tricky way to do this...
```

**How many people have the word Chief in their job title? (This is pretty tricky)**

```python
def chief_string(title):
    if 'chief' in title.lower():
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

```python
sum(sal['JobTitle'].apply(lambda x: chief_string(x)))
```

**Bonus: Is there a correlation between length of the Job Title string and
Salary?**

```python
sal['title_len'] = sal['JobTitle'].apply(len)
```

```python
sal[['title_len','TotalPayBenefits']].corr() # No correlation.
```

# Great Job!
