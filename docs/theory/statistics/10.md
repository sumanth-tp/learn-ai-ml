# How to Calculate P-Values

---

## Introduction

In this StatQuest, we go beyond understanding **what a p-value is** — we
actually learn **how to calculate one**. We'll start with simple examples like
**coin flips**, and gradually move toward **continuous data** such as human
height.

Before diving in, remember:

- This lesson focuses on **two-sided p-values** (the standard approach).
- **One-sided p-values** are risky and should be avoided unless you know exactly
  what you’re doing.

---

## Example 1: Two Heads in a Row

Imagine flipping a coin twice:

- First flip → **Heads**
- Second flip → **Heads**

Now you might think:

> “Wow! My coin must be special!”

But is it really?

### Null Hypothesis (H₀)

> My coin is **no different from a normal fair coin**.

### Goal

Calculate the **p-value** to test whether two heads in a row is unusually rare.

---

### Step 1: List All Outcomes

When flipping a fair coin twice, these are all possible outcomes:

| Flip 1 | Flip 2 | Outcome            |
| ------ | ------ | ------------------ |
| H      | H      | Two Heads          |
| H      | T      | One Head, One Tail |
| T      | H      | One Head, One Tail |
| T      | T      | Two Tails          |

Each has a probability of **1/4 = 0.25**.

So:

- P(Two Heads) = 0.25
- P(Two Tails) = 0.25
- P(One Head, One Tail) = 0.5

---

### Step 2: Build the P-Value

A **p-value** has **three parts**:

| Part | Description                                    | Example Value       |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1    | Probability of getting what we observed        | P(Two Heads) = 0.25 |
| 2    | Probability of something equally rare          | P(Two Tails) = 0.25 |
| 3    | Probability of something rarer or more extreme | None (0)            |

Now, sum them up:

$$
p = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0 = 0.5
$$

✅ **p-value = 0.5**

---

### Step 3: Interpret the Result

Compare p-value to threshold (usually 0.05):

- Since **0.5 > 0.05**, we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis.

💡 Conclusion: Two heads in a row is **not rare** enough to suggest a biased
coin.

---

### Why Add Equally Rare and Rarer Outcomes?

Because rarity loses meaning if many outcomes are equally or more rare. Think of
“rare flowers”:

- If your flower is _the only rare one_ → special 🌸
- If _many others_ are equally rare → not special anymore 😅

That’s why we include parts 2 and 3 — to measure **how truly special** an
outcome is.

---

## Example 2: Four Heads and One Tail

Let’s flip the coin **five times** and get **four heads and one tail**.

We want to test:

> “Even though I got four heads and one tail, my coin is still fair.”

---

### Step 1: Enumerate Possible Outcomes

For 5 flips, there are ( 2^5 = 32 ) possible outcomes.

| Outcome Type     | Number of Ways | Probability |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| 5 Heads          | 1              | 1/32        |
| 4 Heads, 1 Tail  | 5              | 5/32        |
| 3 Heads, 2 Tails | 10             | 10/32       |
| 2 Heads, 3 Tails | 10             | 10/32       |
| 1 Head, 4 Tails  | 5              | 5/32        |
| 0 Heads          | 1              | 1/32        |

---

### Step 2: Calculate P-Value

We combine:

1. P(4 Heads, 1 Tail) = 5/32
2. P(1 Head, 4 Tails) = 5/32 (equally rare)
3. P(5 Heads or 5 Tails) = 2/32 (rarer)

Now sum them:

$$
p = \frac{5 + 5 + 2}{32} = \frac{12}{32} = 0.375
$$

✅ **p-value = 0.375**

---

### Step 3: Interpret

Since **0.375 > 0.05**, we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis. → The coin
still seems **normal** — not biased.

---

## Example 3: Continuous Data (Heights)

Let’s shift to continuous measurements — e.g., **height** of Brazilian women
aged 15–49 (from 1996).

Suppose the distribution looks like this:

![Normal distribution example](/img/height_distribution_example.png)

- Mean = **155.7 cm**
- 95% of women: between **142 cm** and **169 cm**
- 2.5% shorter than 142 cm
- 2.5% taller than 169 cm

---

### Example A: Borderline Case (Height = 142 cm)

If we measure someone 142 cm tall, the p-value includes both tails beyond that
value:

$$
p = 0.025 + 0.025 = 0.05
$$

✅ **p = 0.05 → borderline significant**

It’s unclear if the height came from this distribution or another —
**inconclusive**.

---

### Example B: Significant Case (Height = 141 cm)

At 141 cm, both tails add up to:

$$
p = 0.016 + 0.016 = 0.032
$$

✅ **p = 0.032 < 0.05 → significant**

We can **reject** the null hypothesis that this height came from the original
population.

---

### Example C: Insignificant Case (Height ≈ Mean)

If someone’s height is near 156 cm (close to mean):

- Probability of this range = 0.04
- But everything further left and right adds up to 0.96
- Total p-value = 1.0

✅ **p = 1 → not significant**

Being average is **not unusual**.

---

## One-Sided vs. Two-Sided P-Values

### Two-Sided (Standard)

We care about deviations **in both directions**:

- Shorter _or_ taller than the mean
- Safer, more objective

### One-Sided (Risky)

We only care about one direction — say, “shorter than average.”

#### Example:

We want to test if **SuperDrug** shortens recovery time.

| Scenario                    | Two-Sided p | One-Sided p | Result         |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Faster Recovery (4.5 days)  | 0.03        | 0.016       | Significant    |
| Slower Recovery (15.5 days) | 0.03        | 0.98        | Misses effect! |

→ One-sided tests can **miss dangerous effects**, like a drug making people
worse.

🛑 **Moral:** Avoid one-sided p-values unless you’re an expert.

## Summary of Concepts

| Concept                      | Explanation                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**     | Assumes no difference or effect                         |
| **Two-Sided p-value**        | Includes probabilities in both directions               |
| **Three Parts of p-value**   | Observed outcome + equally rare + more extreme outcomes |
| **Threshold (α = 0.05)**     | Common significance cutoff                              |
| **Continuous Data p-values** | Computed as area under the curve (distribution tails)   |
| **One-Sided p-value**        | Tests only one direction — risky to use                 |
| **Interpretation**           | p < 0.05 → reject H₀; p ≥ 0.05 → fail to reject H₀      |

## Practice Questions

1. What are the three components of a p-value? → Observed outcome, equally rare
   outcomes, and more extreme outcomes.

2. If p = 0.375, what do we conclude? → Fail to reject the null; data are not
   unusual.

3. Why are one-sided p-values risky? → They ignore changes in the opposite
   direction (can miss harmful effects).

4. If height = 141 cm yields p = 0.03, what does that mean? → The observation is
   rare; reject the null hypothesis.

5. What does a p-value of 1 mean? → The data are perfectly consistent with the
   null hypothesis.

> **Key Takeaway:** The p-value combines probabilities of observed, equally
> rare, and more extreme outcomes to tell us **how surprising our data are**
> under the null hypothesis. Smaller p-values mean stronger evidence that
> something unusual — and possibly meaningful — is happening.
